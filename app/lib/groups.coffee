Each of these herbaria are valued collections of plants specimens used in research and teaching.  Their value is amplified in partnership and  SERNEC is devoted to making the resources of all these Herbaria available online as one virtual, researchable collection. SERNEC will improve access to specimen data of a richly biodiverse region, and provide a platform for herbarium curators and plant scientists to exchange ideas, share expertise, and benefit from the value of information shared across institutions."

The project represents a collaboration among eight entomological collections in California to capture data from specimen labels. The Calbug Science Team will then use the collection data to assess how arthropods have responded to climate change and habitat modification. Drawing from over a century of insect collecting in the region, our goal is to develop a database of over 1 million geographically referenced specimens."
