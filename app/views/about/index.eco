<h2>The Project</h2>
<p>
  <img class="right" src="images/about/sernec.jpg">People have been collecting specimens from the natural world for centuries - minerals, plants, fungi and animals. Today, there are an estimated two billion specimens housed in natural history museums around the world! These biological collections document where species and populations exist now and where they existed decades and centuries before, so they hold irreplaceable information necessary for uncovering the patterns of changes in species distributions and ecosystem composition over time. Scientists use such data and information in order to address key environmental issues we are facing right now, such as the impacts of climate change and how diseases affect wildlife and humans.
</p>
<p>
  For the information held in these collections to be used to its full potential there must be better digital access to these data. Most natural history collections are housed in museum cabinets, where they are not easily available to citizens and researchers. Only a small fraction of all natural history specimens is available digitally over the Internet, while the vast majority remains locked away from view in an inflexible, limited format. The Notes from Nature transcription project is a citizen science platform built to address this problem by digitizing the world’s biological collections one record at a time!

<h3>People and Partners</h3>
<p>
  Multiple collections, containing specimens representing over 200 institutions, are currently involved with Notes from Nature. Meet some of the primary scientists, collaborators and developers:

    Kip Will, Rosemary Gillespie, Joanie Ball, Meghan Culpepper, Joyce Gross and Peter Oboyski at the University of California at Berkeley, who are key participants in the CalBug project. <a href="http://calbug.berkeley.edu/Overview.html">Calbug</a> is a collaborative digitizing project that includes the nine major insect collections in California - the <a href="http://essig.berkeley.edu/">Essig Museum of Entomology</a> at UC Berkeley, the <a href="http://research.calacademy.org/ent">California Academy of Sciences</a>, the <a href="http://www.cdfa.ca.gov/plant/PPD/csca.html">California State Collection of Arthropods</a>, the <a href="http://bohart.ucdavis.edu/">Bohart Museum</a> at UC Davis, the <a href="http://entmuseum.ucr.edu/">Entomology Research Museum UC Riverside</a>, <a href="http://mnhc.ucsc.edu/">Museum of Natural History Collections at UC Santa Cruz</a>, <ahref="http://www.sdnhm.org/science/entomology/">San Diego Natural History Museum</ahref=>, <a href="http://www.sbnature.org/collections/invert/entom/ent01.htm">Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History</a>, and the <a href="http://www.nhm.org/site/research-collections/entomology">LA County Museum</a>.  These collections are comprised of pinned insects with labels and are a prime example of the stunning diversity of insect life.

    <a href="http://www.neoninc.org/about/staff/michael-denslow">Michael Denslow</a> at NEON, <a href="http://biology.appstate.edu/faculty-staff/103">Zack Murrell</a> at Appalachian State University, and <a href="http://dmconsult.library.virginia.edu/aboutus/">Andrew Sallans</a> at University of Virginia, who are key participants in the <a href="http://www.sernec.org/">South Eastern Regional Network of Expertise and Collections (SERNEC)</a> project. SERNEC is a collaborative collection from about 222 herbaria across the Southeastern United States, representing over 12 million plant specimens! Each specimen in Notes from Nature includes a herbarium sheet image, where you can see the dried plant mounted on the paper and labeled with species and habitat information.

    Tim Conyers, Database Manager at the Natural History Museum of London (NHML). Tim is responsible for zoology digitization projects at NHML and the Museum’s collections management system. The NHML has digitized its bird ledgers, which is one of the world's richest collections of historical specimens, spanning over a hundred years and covering the globe!

    <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/robgur/">Rob Guralnick</a> and Aly Seeberger, from the <a href="http://cumuseum.colorado.edu/">University of Colorado Museum of Natural History</a>, who have provided test datasets in order to determine the cost, accuracy and speed of volunteer transcriptions compared to other methods, and helped test Notes from Nature.
  </li>
  <li>
    The teams from <a href="http://vizzuality.com/">Vizzuality</a> and the <a href="https://www.zooniverse.org/">Zooniverse</a> who helped create the look and feel of the project

<h3>Notes from Nature and You</h3>
<p>
  <img class="right" src="images/about/calbug.jpg">Natural history museums across the world share a common goal – to make scientific data accessible to those who would use it. The Notes from Nature project gives you the opportunity to make a scientifically important contribution. Every transcription that is completed brings us closer to filling gaps in our knowledge of global biodiversity. Help museum staff and scientists by transcribing the labels and ledgers that have been meticulously recorded and stored for the very reason that they might be someday be useful. Join us in unlocking this important information - take some notes from nature!
